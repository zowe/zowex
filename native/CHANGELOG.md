# Change Log

All notable changes to the native code for "zowex" are documented in this file.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## Recent Changes

- `c`: Changed `zowex --version` and `zowex -v` to return just the version number. [#925](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/925)
- `c`: Removed duplicate `-v` and `--version` aliases on the `zowex version` command. [#922](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/922)
- `c`: Added the `getInfo` RPC to retrieve the middleware version and build information. [#922](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/922)
- `c`: Added a DCB abend exit for handling edge cases around PDS member open, write, and close operations. When an abend is encountered, it is either delayed or ignored (when applicable) and an error is returned gracefully via the diagnostic structure (`ZDIAG`) rather than terminating the process. Refer to [DCB abend exits](doc/dcb-abend-exit.md) for more information on how and when abends are handled. **Note:** In the event of an end-of-space (end-of-volume) abend, the operating system closes the DCB if the ignore request is honored from the abend exit. However, the abend might still percolate during end-of-volume `CLOSE` routines. An ESTAE/ESTAEX recovery routine should be used to gracefully handle these cases. [#839](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/839)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where listing the members of a protected, partitioned data set resulted in an unclear error message. Now, the error messages are more specific and include information about insufficient permissions when applicable. [#297](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/297)

## `0.4.0`

- `c`: Added `zowex uss issue` command and the `unixCommand` RPC for executing USS shell commands using `spawn()` with `_BPX_SHAREAS=YES` for efficient same-address-space execution. [#867](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/867)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where submitting JCL from the VS Code editor with CRLF line endings caused job submission errors. [#882](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/882)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where VSAM index or data components returned `*VSAM*` for the volume serial. Now, an accurate volume serial is returned for both component types. [#864](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/864)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where listing data sets would fail with an "unsupported entry type" error if the pattern matched a VSAM PATH or alternate index (AIX). Now, matching VSAM PATH or AIX data sets are returned in the list results. [#841](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/841)
- `c`: Added `zowex system view-syslog` command. [#829](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/829)
- `c`: Added an option for command handler arguments to coerce all input values into a string, allowing developers to have more control over expected formatting and type constraints. [#875](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/875)
- **Breaking:** `c`: Renamed the `zds_read_from_dsn` function to `zds_read`. [#831](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/831)
- **Breaking:** `c`: Removed the `zds_read_from_dd` function in favor of the newly-consolidated `zds_read` function. [#831](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/831)
- **Breaking:** `c`: Removed the standalone `zowed` binary and its entry point. The server is now exclusively an embedded subcommand of `zowex` (the z/OS backend CLI binary) via `zowex server`, eliminating the need for a separate binary and `libzowed.so` dynamic loading. [#846](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/846)
- **Breaking:** `c`: Renamed the `ZOWED_NUM_WORKERS` environment variable to `ZOWEX_NUM_WORKERS` (controls the number of parallel worker threads the server uses to handle requests). [#846](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/846)
- `c`: Enabled `-O2` optimization for release builds, improving runtime performance of native binaries. [#846](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/846)
- `c`: Added `zowex system list-subsystems` with optional filter. [#842](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/842)
- `c`: Added `zowex system` command group and relocated items `list-parmlib`, `list-proclib`, and `display-symbol` from `zowex tool` to this group. [#843](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/843) and [#844](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/844)
- `c`: Added support for displaying member statistics. [#630](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/630)
- `c`: Added `toolSearch` command in the server (used to search for data sets) for use by client SDK.
- `c`: Added the `pattern` option to the `data-set list-members` zowex command to filter the returned members. [#817](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/817)
- `c`: Implemented `zowex uss copy` command to copy USS files and directories. [#379](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/379)
- `c`: Implemented `zowex uss move` command to move files and directories in z/OS Unix. [#378](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/378)
- `python`: Implemented basic move APIs and fixed build issues. [#789](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/789)
- `c`: Updated the `gen_chdsect.sh` shell script used to generate chdsect header files to generate appropriate pragma syntax expected by the `ibm-clang` C/C++ compiler. When the headers are included in Open XL-compiled code, the new pragma syntax is used. Otherwise, the legacy `pack(packed)` and `pack(reset)` macro syntax is used. [#368](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/368)
- `native`: Migrated compiler from xlclang/xlclang++ to ibm-clang/ibm-clang++ (Open XL C/C++, v2.1, supports C++17). The `xlclang-extenders` makefile target has been removed in favor of the `all` target. [#653](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/653)
- `c`: Modernized C++ code to align with C++17 best practices and adopted new standard library implementations (`unordered_map`, `to_string`, `if constexpr`, brace initialization, etc.). [#812](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/812)
- `c`: Removed all cases of `using namespace std` in native code to prevent namespace collisions and unintended effects on API consumers. All uses of `std` classes and utilities are now explicitly prefixed with `std::`. [#812](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/812)
- `c`: Removed redundant standard library utilities from the `zstd.hpp` C++ header, in favor of the verified implementations included with ibm-clang and C++17. [#812](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/812)
- `c`: Renamed `zut_int_to_string` to `zut_hex_to_string` to align with use cases for the function. [#812](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/812)

## `0.2.4`

- `c`: Fixed an issue where errors during `zowex` initialization and command execution were unhandled, causing abends as a result. Now, if a fatal error is encountered, the error is caught and its details are displayed before the process exits. [#784](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/784)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where the `zowex uss list` command would return the file type `d` for symlinked directories instead of `l`. Now, symlinks in a file list are marked with file type `l`. [#791](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/791)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where the `zowex uss delete` command could not remove symlinks or directories containing symlinks. Now, the command properly deletes a directory with a symlink in it, and treats the link as a file. No sub-directories or files in the target link are deleted. [#792](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/792)
- `c`: Added support for `multivolume` attribute when listing data sets. [#782](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/782)
- `c`: Fixed an issue with the `zowex ds write` command where e-tag arguments without alphabetic characters resulted in e-tag validation being skipped. Now, e-tag validation is performed regardless of whether the e-tag contains alphabetic characters. [#676](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/676)

## `0.2.3`

- `c`: Added `zowex ds copy` command to copy data sets and members with optional `--replace` flag (overwrites matching members) and `--delete-target-members` flag (deletes all target members before copying, making target match source exactly). Supports PDS-to-PDS, member-to-member, and sequential-to-sequential copies. Note: RECFM=U data sets are not supported. [#750](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/750)
- `c`: Added rename data set members functionality to the backend. [#765](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/765)
- `c`: Implement `zowex job watch` command to watch spool output for a string or regex until terminating.
- `c`: Implement `zut_bpxwdyn_rtdsn` to obtain and return a system allocated data set name.
- `c`: Implement command `zowex job view-file` to print contents of a job output data set.
- The `zowex job submit-jcl` command now displays the submitted job in the following format: `JobName(JobId)` [#733](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/733)
- `c`: Rename command `zowex job view-file` to `zowex job view-file-by-id` so that `view-file` can be used to print a specific file (data set) name. [#740](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/740)
- `c`: The zowex CLI parser now supports enabling passthrough arguments for commands. When enabled, arguments passed after a double-dash (`--`) are passed directly to the command as raw input. [#729](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/729)
- Added the rename dataset functionality to the backend. [#376](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/376)
- `c`: Fixed results being truncated when listing all jobs on a system. [#735](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/735)
- `c`: Fixed default behavior of `zowex job list` command to list jobs for only the current user. [#739](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/739)
- `c`: Added `--status` argument to `zowex job list` command that supports filtering by job status. [#743](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/743)
- `zowed`: Fixed `maxItems` property being ignored when listing data sets and jobs. [#745](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/745)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where writing to a `RECFM=U` data set could exhibit undefined behavior. Now, writing to a `RECFM=U` data set results in an explicit error as the record format is supported as read-only. [#751](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/751)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where BPAM write operations would accidentally wipe the contents of a data set if one of the lines exceeded the record length. Now, the line is truncated according to the max record length of the data set, and the user is warned about line ranges that exceed the record length. [#587](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/587)
- `c`: PDS and PDSE members are now edited using a partitioned access method to preserve and update ISPF statistics. [#587](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/587)
- `c`: Added support for handling ASA control characters when writing to sequential and partitioned data sets. [#751](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/751)
- `c`: Added support for line truncation detection when writing to data sets. The truncated line ranges are displayed as a warning message after the write process is complete. [#751](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/751)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where the output stream was checked to determine the input method for write commands, causing unexpected behavior when piping data to the commands. Now, the commands check if the input stream is a pseudo-terminal before continuing. [#756](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/756)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where the write commands would inadvertently add duplicate newlines when reading user input in interactive mode. Now, a newline character is only added between lines and after the first line of text is processed. [#755](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/755)

## `0.2.2`

- `c`: Re-enable `zowex ds compress` and correct 0C4 abend. [#640](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/640)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where `--wait ACTIVE` on `zowex job` commands would wait indefinitely if the job was fast enough to reach the `OUTPUT` phase before polling its status. [#700](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/700)
- `zowed`: Fixed `message` property of `error` object in the JSON response to contain valuable details about errors thrown by `zowex`. [#712](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/712)
- `c`: You can now access dynamic arguments from a command handler through its `InvocationContext` parameter. [#715](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/715)
- `zowed`: Fixed an issue where the `submitJcl` command failed if an encoding was not specified for the JCL contents. [#724](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/724)
- `c`: Fixed an issue where multibyte codepages like IBM-939 were not always encoded correctly when writing data sets and USS files. [#718](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/718)

## `0.2.1`

- `c`: Disallow `zowex compress ds` to prevent lurking abend.
- `c`: Fixed `zowex uss create-file` and `create-dir` commands to respect the `mode` option when provided. [#626](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/626)
- `c`: Fixed issue where `zowex uss chown` (and `zusf_chown_uss_file_or_dir`) silently succeeded with exit code `0` when a non-existent user or group was supplied. The command now validates `user:group` input and returns a non-zero exit code with a clear error message when invalid. [#565](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/565)
- `c`: Fixed issue where uploading changes to a data set did not always flush to disk. [#643](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/643)
- `c`: Updated commands that read data from stdin to read literal text rather than parsing hex string. [#645](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/645)
- `c`: Reverted previous fix to preserve ISPF stats on PDS members since it could cause uploading changes to fail. [#669](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/669)
- `zowed`: Fixed issue where enabling verbose logging would cause a deadlock during initialization. [#652](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/652)
- `zowed`: Implemented support for automatic worker recovery. If a worker crashes or throws an exception, it is replaced with a new worker. If the maximum number of replacement attempts have been exceeded, the worker is disabled to prevent thrashing the CPU with replacement requests. [#410](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/410)
- `zowed`: Optimized the `get_ready_worker` function to avoid worst-case linear search for the next available worker. [#651](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/651)
- `zowed`: Replaced the options logic with the parser library to avoid code duplication and establish consistency with backend. [#655](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/655)
- `zowed`: Implemented support for server-side request timeouts. If the request timeout is exceeded for a single worker, the hanging worker is replaced and the ongoing request is discarded. [#416](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/416)
- `c`: De-duplicated makefile contents through `.INCLUDE` keyword and separate toolchain file. [#651](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/651)
- `zowed`: Fixed issue where opening a file larger than 10 MB could fail with "Invalid JSON" error. [#656](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/656)
- `c`: Fix PSW alignment issue. [#559](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/559)
- When listing data sets with attributes, a comprehensive set is now retrieved that is similar to what ISPF displays. [#629](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/629)

## `0.2.0`

- `c`: Fixed issue where uploading changes to a PDS member removed its ISPF stats. [#556](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/556)
- `c`: Streamlined argument checks and access within command handlers. Handlers can now use `get`, `get_if` and `find` to search for arguments and retrieve their values, regardless of whether the argument is a keyword or positional argument. [#574](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/574)
- `c`: Command handlers can now be called directly by providing an `InvocationContext`. The context provides helper functions for error, input, and output stream redirection. Handlers can use this context to print output and errors, as well as setting content length. [#574](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/574)
- `c`: Organized command handlers into separate source files and namespaces in the `commands` folder. Reduced size of main entrypoint function by moving command registration to a `register_commands` function contained in each namespace. [#409](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/409)
- `native`: Added a `--depth` option to the `zowex uss list` command for listing USS directories recursively. [#575](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/575)
- `native`: Added `zowex job list-proclib` to list proclib concatenation.
- `c`: Fixed issue where a directory handle was leaked when running `chmod`, `chown`, `chtag` or `delete` USS commands. [#577](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/577)
- `c`: Fixed issue where a file handle was leaked if the `fldata` function call failed when listing data set members. [#577](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/577)
- `c`: Fixed issue where a file handle was leaked if the `fldata` function call failed in the `handle_data_set_compress` command handler. [#577](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/577)
- `c`: Fixed issue in the `zut_substitute_symbol` function where passing patterns with a length greater than the input buffer would cause a buffer overflow. [#577](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/577)
- `c`: Fixed undefined behavior in the `zut_bpxwdyn` function by verifying that the allocated 31-bit region is valid before writing to it. [#577](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/577)
- `c`: The CLI parser now prints unexpected, trailing positional arguments when handling command input. [#594](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/594)
- Rewrote the middleware (`zowed`) in C++. This removes our dependency on Golang, improves performance, and allows parallel requests to be handled in a single address space. [#595](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/595)
- `c`: Fixed issue where automatic codepage conversion with `_BPXK_AUTOCVT` was not disabled for all USS read and write operations, which could interfere with the `--encoding` option. [#620](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/620)

## `0.1.10`

- `c`: Added `zowex tool list-parmlib` command to list parmlib concatenation data sets.
- Added plug-in support to the `zowex` backend. Plug-ins can contribute commands that users invoke through `zowex`. For more information on how to create and register a plug-in with `zowex`, please refer to the `plugins.md` file in the `doc/` root-level folder. [#148](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/148)

## `0.1.9`

- `golang`: Fixed an issue where an empty response on the `HandleReadFileRequest` function would result in a panic. [#550](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/550)
- `c`: Fixed issue where the `zowex ds lm` command always returned non-zero exit code for warnings and ignored the `--no-warn` flag. [#498](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/498)
- `c`: Fixed issue where the `zowex job submit-jcl` command submitted the given JCL contents twice, causing two jobs to be created. [#508](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/508)
- `c`: Implemented a logger for Metal C and C++ source code for diagnostics, debug information, and printing dumps. When enabled, log messages are written to a log file named `zowex.log` in a new `logs` folder, relative to the location of the `zowex` binary. [#107](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/107)
- `golang`: Moved location of log file inside "logs" directory to be consistent with `zowex`. [#514](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/514)
- `c`: Fixed issue where the `zowex ds write` command automatically created a data set when it did not exist. [#292](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/292)
- `native`: Fixed issue where the `zowex ds ls` command could hang when listing data sets that the system cannot open. [#496](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/496)
- `c`: Added `--local-encoding` option for read and write operations on data sets, USS files, and job files to specify the source encoding of content (defaults to UTF-8). [#511](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/511)
- `c`: Fixed issue where the `zowex ds create` command did not parse `--alcunit` and integer arguments (e.g., `--primary`). [#414](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/414)
- `c`: Fixed issue where listing data sets fails if the `OBTAIN` service fails while obtaining attributes for a data set in the list of matches. [#529](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/529)
- `native`: Added support for `volser` option when reading/writing data sets. [#439](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/439)
- `native`: Reduced number of memory allocations in vectors by reserving capacity before adding elements. [#522](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/522)
- `c`: Added wrappers for Web Enablement Toolkit to be invoked via Metal C as header only or from LE-C using a 64-bit wrapper.
- `c`: Added the `zstd::optional` class for handling optional values.
- `c`: Added the `zstd::unique_ptr` class and `zstd::make_unique` function for RAII-based automatic memory management.
- `c`: Added the `zstd::expected` class for error handling similar to Rust `Result` type.

## `0.1.8`

- `native`: Added default value for `--recfm` so that when no options are specified the data set will not contain errors. [#493](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/493)
- Fixed issue where special characters were detected as invalid characters when provided to `zowex` commands. [#491](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/491)
- `native`: Increase default max returned entries in `zowex ds list` from 100 to 5000. This helps with [#487](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/487) but does not fix it. In the future, users should be able to specify on the Zowe Clients the max number of entries.

## `0.1.7`

- Updated CLI parser `find_kw_arg_bool` function to take in an optional boolean `check_for_negation` that, when `true`, looks for a negated option value. [#485](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/485)
- Fixed issue where listing data set members did not check for the negated option value. Now, the command handler passes the `check_for_negation` option to the `find_kw_arg_bool` function to check the value of the negated, equivalent option. [#485](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/485)
- `golang`: Fixed inconsistent type of the `data` property between the `ReadDatasetResponse` and `ReadFileResponse` types. [#488](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/488)

## `0.1.6`

- `native`: Fixed regression where data set download operations would fail due to a content length mismatch, due to the content length being printed as hexadecimal rather than decimal. [#482](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/482)

## `0.1.5`

- `native`: Added completion code for `POST` so that users of the library code may determine if a timeout has occurred.
- `native`: Added `timeout` for `zowex console issue` to prevent indefinite hang when no messages are returned. [#470](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/470)
- `native`: Added `contentLen` property to RPC responses for reading/writing data sets and USS files. [#358](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/358)
- `native`: Fixed file tag being prioritized over user-specified codepage when reading/writing USS files. [#467](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/467)
- `native`: Fixed issue where `max-entries` argument was incorrectly parsed as a string rather than an integer. [#469](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/469)
- `native`: The `zowex` root command now has a command handler to make adding new options easier. [#468](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/468)

## `0.1.4`

- `c`: Fixed an issue where the CLI help text showed the `[options]` placeholder in the usage example before the positional arguments, which is not a supported syntax. Now, the usage text shows the `[options]` placeholder after the positional arguments for the given command.
- `c`: Added `zowex version` command to print the latest build information for the `zowex` executable. The version output contains the build date and the package version. [#366](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/366)
- `c`: Added `full_status` variable from job output to the CSV output for the `zowex job view-status --rfc` command. [#450](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/450)
- `golang`: If the `zowed` process abnormally terminates due to a SIGINT or SIGTERM signal, the worker processes are now gracefully terminated. [#372](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/372)
- `c`: Updated `zowex uss list` command to provide same attributes as output from the `ls -l` UNIX command when the `--long` flag is specified. [#346](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/346)
- `c`: Updated `zowex uss list` command to match format of the `ls -l` UNIX command. [#383](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/383)
- `c`: Added `response-format-csv` option to the `zowex uss list` command to print the file attributes in CSV format. [#346](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/346)
- `golang`: Added additional data points to the USS item response for the `HandleListFilesRequest` command handler. [#346](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/346)

## `0.1.3`

- `c`: Fixed S0C4 where supervisor state, key 4 caller invokes `zcn_put` while running in SUPERVISOR state. [#392](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/392)
- `c`: Fixed S0C4 where supervisor state, key 4 caller invokes `zcn` APIs and several miscellaneous issues. [#389](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/389)
- `c`: Fixed issue where canceled jobs displayed as "CC nnnn" instead of the string "CANCELED". [#169](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/169)
- `c`: Fixed issue where input job SYSOUT files could not be listed or displayed". [#196](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/196)
- `native`: Fixed issue where `zowed` failed to process RPC requests larger than 64 KB. [#364](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/364)
- `golang`: `zowed` now returns the UNIX permissions for each item's `mode` property in a USS list response. [#341](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/341)
- `c`: Added `--long` option to the `zowex uss list` command to return the long format for list output, containing additional file metadata. [#341](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/341)
