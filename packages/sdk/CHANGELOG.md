## Recent Changes

- **Breaking:** Modified `promptForProfile` function to use an options object for `setExistingProfile` and `prioritizeProjectLevelConfig` parameters. [#964](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/964)
- Added `prioritizeProjectLevelConfig` to the options parameter for `promptForProfile` function to allow toggling between project-level and global configuration creation when setting up new SSH profiles. [#964](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/964)
- Updated the `russh` dependency for technical currency. [#963](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/963)

## `0.5.0`

- Added support for copying data sets and members files in the `RpcClientApi` class. [#932](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/932)
- Fixed an issue when searching a single member did not returned properly parsed results. [#941](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/941)
- Added support for invoking the `getInfo` server command, which allows the client SDK to get version and build information from the server. [#922](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/922)
- Added warning to `AbstractConfigManager.validateDeployPath` method when server path ends in `/c/build-out`, preventing developers from accidentally overwriting a dev deployment. [#912](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/912)
- Added `overwrite` property to the `CreateMemberRequest` and `CreateFileRequest` types. [#642](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/642)

## `0.4.0`

- **Breaking:** `ZSshClient` (the SSH-based client for communicating with the z/OS server) now connects to `zowex server` (the embedded server subcommand of the `zowex` z/OS backend binary) instead of the standalone `zowed` binary. Users must re-deploy the server to update the binaries at their `serverPath` (the z/OS path where server binaries are deployed). [#846](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/846)
- Updated `ZSshClient` so callers can now safely collect and replay in-flight requests when they detect an unrecoverable error. [#548](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/548)
- Added support for issuing USS shell commands via `uss.issueCmd` (backed by the new `unixCommand` RPC). [#867](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/867)
- Added expired password detection (`FOTS1668`/`FOTS1669`) in `installServer` and `uninstallServer`, throwing an `ImperativeError` with `errorCode: "EPASSWD_EXPIRED"` instead of returning a generic failure. [#867](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/867)
- Added support for listing member attributes to `DsMember` type [#630](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/630)
- Added support for invoking the `toolSearch` server command, which allows the client SDK to search for data sets.
- Added support for copying USS files in the `RpcClientApi` class. [#379](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/issues/379)
- Added support for USS Move operations. [#789](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/789)
- Fixed `user` property not defined as secure when new team configuration profile is created. [#845](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/845)
- Fixed check for outdated server always returning true which could trigger unnecessary re-deploy. [#862](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/862)
- Added experimental native client for improved performance. To enable it, pass the `useNativeSsh` option to the `ZSshClient.create` method. [#833](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/833)
