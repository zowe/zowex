# Test plan: `system cert` / `system keyring` (certificates command group)

Status: living document, introduced with [PR #1079](https://github.com/zowe/zowex/pull/1079)
(migration of [`keyring-utilities`](https://github.com/zowe/keyring-utilities) into zowex).

Scope: the `zkr` service layer (R_datalib / IRRSDL64 + System SSL GSKCMS), the
`system cert` / `system keyring` CLI groups, the 14 certificate JSON-RPC methods,
and their SDK/CLI TypeScript surface.

## 1. How the automation is tiered

The C++ suite (`native/c/test/zkr.test.cpp`) runs on a real z/OS system via
`npm run z:test` (CI: `.github/workflows/zos-build.yml`). It has three tiers:

| Tier | Gate | What runs |
|---|---|---|
| Unconditional | none | CLI argument/virtual-ring validation, SAF error diagnostics, `zkr_filter_certs` filter-semantics unit tests (RACDCERT LABEL parity) |
| Authority-gated | `can_mutate` probe: the test user can `zkr_new_ring` | key ring lifecycle (create / list empty / GetRingInfo / delete; delete-nonexistent diagnostics) |
| Authority + fixture | `can_mutate` **and** a PKCS#12 fixture | certificate lifecycle: import → list (incl. `--label` filter parity) → show → export PEM → set-default → connect (from ring) → trust → rename → delete from DB |

The fixture is supplied out-of-band (`ZKR_TEST_P12` = USS path to a PKCS#12
file, `ZKR_TEST_P12_PASS` = its passphrase) so no key material is committed to
the repo. Gated tests **skip** (not fail) when their gate is closed, so the
suite passes for any user — but skipped tests provide no coverage. CI currently
runs with both gates closed.

## 2. Coverage matrix

"zowe-mcp" marks methods exercised on a real system by
[zowe-mcp#45](https://github.com/zowe/zowe-mcp/pull/45) — the field-proven
"don't break" set.

| RPC method | zowe-mcp | Automation today | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| `showCertificate` | ✅ | gated lifecycle | — |
| `connectCertificate` | ✅ | gated (`--from-ring`) | `--from-database` never exercised anywhere |
| `deleteCertificate` | ✅ | gated (database delete only) | ring-scoped disconnect + auto-refresh (SAF 4/4/12) untested |
| `exportCertificate` | ✅ | gated (PEM only) | p12 / `gsk_export_key` path untested |
| `importCertificate` | ✅ | gated happy path | warning branches untested: already-exists (rsn 8/12/16), refresh-failed fallback |
| `setDefaultCertificate` | ✅ | gated lifecycle | — |
| `trustCertificate` | ✅ | gated (NOTRUST↔TRUST) | HIGHTRUST never exercised |
| `renameCertificate` | ✅ | gated (rename + back) | — |
| `refreshDigtcert` | ✅ | indirect only (delete auto-refresh) | no standalone test |
| `listCertificates` | — | gated list + unconditional filter unit suite | cap/`moreAvailable` never hit against a real >10-cert ring |
| `listRings` | — | gated (one call) | binary result-area parser + 256 KB truncation path: zero real exposure |
| `countRing` | — | **none** | both branches (virtual-ring enumeration, GetRingInfo sum) |
| `createKeyring` | — | gated ring lifecycle | — |
| `deleteKeyring` | — | gated (incl. error path) | — |

Layers with **no automation at any tier**: JSON-RPC dispatch + schema
validation for these 14 methods, the SDK TypeScript client, the CLI TypeScript
handlers.

## 3. Plan

### Item 1 — unlock the gated suites in CI (one-time infra)

Grant the CI user (Marist system, `SSH_MARIST_RACF_HOST`) authority to manage
**its own** rings and certificates. READ access to the FACILITY-class profiles:

```
IRR.DIGTCERT.ADD        IRR.DIGTCERT.ADDRING    IRR.DIGTCERT.ALTER
IRR.DIGTCERT.CONNECT    IRR.DIGTCERT.DELETE     IRR.DIGTCERT.DELRING
IRR.DIGTCERT.EXPORT     IRR.DIGTCERT.GENCERT    IRR.DIGTCERT.LIST
IRR.DIGTCERT.LISTRING   IRR.DIGTCERT.REMOVE
```

(or an equivalent `RDATALIB <ciuser>.**` profile). The suites are designed for
a shared system: scratch rings are namespaced `ZKRUT.*` with pid+random
suffixes and purged in `afterAll`.

The fixture can alternatively be provided per-environment via the `testEnv:`
map in `config.yaml` (already plumbed through `scripts/buildTools.ts` into the
remote `ztest_runner` invocation) — but item 2 makes that unnecessary.

### Item 2 — self-provisioning fixture (no out-of-band secret)

When `ZKR_TEST_P12` is **not** set and the authority probe passed, the suite
provisions its own throwaway fixture at run time via `tsocmd`:

1. `RACDCERT GENCERT SUBJECTSDN(CN('ZKRUT <unique>')) WITHLABEL('<unique>') SIZE(2048)`
2. `RACDCERT EXPORT (LABEL('<unique>')) DSN('<user>.ZKRUT.<unique>.P12') FORMAT(PKCS12DER) PASSWORD('<generated>')`
3. `RACDCERT DELETE (LABEL('<unique>'))` — so the exported cert is unknown to
   the RACF DB again and the subsequent import is a genuinely new certificate
4. `cp -B "//'<dsn>'" <uss tmp file>` — binary copy of the DER stream
5. `DELETE '<dsn>'` + remove the USS file in cleanup

Degrades gracefully: any step failing (typically missing
`IRR.DIGTCERT.GENCERT`/`EXPORT` authority) logs the reason and the lifecycle
suite skips exactly as it does today. An explicit `ZKR_TEST_P12` still takes
precedence, so environments with a curated fixture keep using it.

### Item 3 — new gated tests for the uncovered paths

In priority order (zowe-mcp-used first):

1. **p12 export → re-import round trip** — export with a password, import
   under a new label, `show` both. This is also the missing PEM/PKCS#12 parity
   coverage and pins the export-password behavior.
2. **Import the same p12 twice** (different label) — deterministically hits
   the already-exists warning path (SAF 4, RACF rsn 8/12/16); assert the
   `warning` diagnostic.
3. **Ring-scoped delete** — connect a cert to two rings, disconnect from one,
   assert it remains on the other (exercises the 4/4/12 auto-refresh).
4. **`connect --from-database`** — settles empirically whether DataGetFirst on
   the virtual ring can source certificate bytes (code comment and CLI help
   currently disagree); whichever way, the test documents real behavior.
5. **`countRing`** — real ring after one import (=1) and virtual ring (>=1).
6. **Standalone `refresh`**.
7. **Real pagination** — loop `RACDCERT GENCERT` to put >10 distinct certs on
   one ring; assert `--max-entries 10` sets `moreAvailable` and `--label`
   finds the last cert. Slow (~12 RACDCERT calls): use a long `TEST_OPTIONS`
   timeout.

Stays manual / unit-level: the `listRings` 256 KB truncation path (would need
thousands of rings; better served by making the result-area size injectable
and unit-testing the parser on synthetic buffers — no z/OS needed).

### Item 4 — RPC-layer tests

The C++ tests bypass JSON-RPC dispatch, so schema/validation bugs are
invisible to them (e.g. a handler emitting a field the response schema
rejects). Add a python test (the `z:test:python` harness,
`.github/workflows/zos-py-build.yml` — infrastructure that already runs in CI)
that starts `zowex server`, invokes the certificate methods, and asserts:

- request validation rejects missing required fields (`-32602`-class errors)
- responses pass their schemas (server-side response validation not tripped)
- error responses carry `safReturns` with the SAF/ESM codes
- read-only methods (`listRings`, `listCertificates`, `countRing`) work
  without mutation authority

### Manual test checklist (until items 2–4 land)

For release validation on a real system, in addition to the automated suites:

- [ ] `cert export -F p12` with `--password` (and confirm omitting `--password` is rejected)
- [ ] `cert import` over an existing certificate (label ignored warning)
- [ ] `cert delete <ring>` (disconnect) and `--database` variants
- [ ] `cert connect --from-database`
- [ ] `keyring count` for a real ring and `'*'`
- [ ] `keyring list` on a ring with more than 10 certificates, with and
      without `--label`/`--usage`
- [ ] `cert trust -s HIGHTRUST` on a CERTAUTH certificate
- [ ] byte-parity of exported PEM/p12 against `keyring-util` output for the
      same certificate

## 4. Running the suites

```bash
npm run z:test                       # full C++ suite on the configured system
npm run z:test -- certificates       # only the certificate suites
ZNP_ZKR_TEST_P12=/u/user/f.p12 ZNP_ZKR_TEST_P12_PASS=secret npm run z:test   # curated fixture
```

`config.yaml` (repo root, gitignored) supplies the target system. Extra env
for the remote test runner comes from the `testEnv:` map in `config.yaml`
(exact names) or local `ZNP_`-prefixed variables, which are forwarded
**verbatim** (prefix included) — the certificate suite therefore accepts both
`ZKR_TEST_P12` and `ZNP_ZKR_TEST_P12` (and the same for `..._P12_PASS`).
